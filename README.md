*Project 1*

This project is part of my coursework in Analytics and Leadership Development. It is designed to provide self-reflection on personal strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) and to assess my capacity to handle both organizational and technical complexity as an aspiring leader in analytics.
The assignment is divided into two main parts:

Part 1 – SWOT Analyses
A Personal SWOT Analysis focusing on me as an individual.
A Leadership SWOT Analysis focusing on me as a potential leader in the analytics field.
Each matrix contains at least three examples in all four quadrants:
- Strengths
- Weaknesses
- Opportunities
- Threats
Includes a one-page reflection paper discussing key findings, how I plan to address weaknesses, and how I can reinforce my strengths.

Part 2 – Complexity Grid Self-Assessment
A self-assessment of my hard skills (technical, analytical, problem-solving) and soft skills (communication, leadership, collaboration).
Placement of my current abilities on the Complexity Grid (balancing organizational and technical complexity).
A discussion of:
- Where I am now in terms of skill balance.
- Where I want to be in the future.
- Steps I plan to take to enhance both hard and soft skills.


*Key Learnings*

- Developed self-awareness about my strengths (analytical ability, adaptability, problem-solving) and weaknesses (overcommitment, need for improved financial planning knowledge).
- Identified leadership styles I align with, blending transformational and coaching leadership approaches for analytics contexts.
- Mapped myself on the Complexity Grid as someone with strong hard skills and developing soft skills, with a goal to reach a balanced quadrant through deliberate practice in leadership and collaboration.
- Outlined an actionable plan to reinforce strengths, address weaknesses, and grow into a consistent leadership style suitable for analytics-driven organizations.
